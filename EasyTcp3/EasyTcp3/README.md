# Project structure
The EasyTcpClient & EasyTcpServer classes contain only the variables and core functions. <br/>
Other functions can be found in `Util` classes. <br/>
This prevents 1 very big file with code. All util classes have 1 specific goal. <br/>

# XML comments
All functions, classes and have xml comments. All new code should have XML comments.
